<h2> Collective motion of many active particles </h2>

<p>

In collaboration with Art Evans (UW-Madison), Michael Shelley (NYU), and Saverio Spagnolie (UW-Madison), we model a bacterial swarm in a continuum model of swimming particles where their interactions are mediated through the surrounding fluid flow.  This approach leads to a Smoluchowski equation, an equation for the single-particle distribution. We are investigating the dynamics of bacterial clusters within a fluid.
