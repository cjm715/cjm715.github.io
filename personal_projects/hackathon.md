## Complex systems hackathon

This was an experiment in collaborative research. During my time as organizer of a graduate student complex systems group ([CSAAW](https://lsa.umich.edu/cscs/graduate-students/csaaw.html)), my co-organizer [Sara Aronwitz](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~skaron/) and I planned and carried out a 36-hr science hackathon -- the first ever held at University of Michigan. Instead of trying to develop computer software or hardware like a typical computer science hackathon, the goal is to conduct research in short period of time. The event was modeled after and inspired by a similar event held at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI). For more information, see links below:
