## Complex systems hackathon

This was an experiment in collaborative research. As an organizer of a graduate student complex systems group (CSAAW), we planned and carried out a 36-hr science hackathon -- the first ever held at University of Michigan. A science hackathon is different than a typical hackathon that you may be familiar with, like MHacks. Instead of trying to develop computer software or hardware, the goal is to conduct research in short period of time. The event was modeled after and inspired by a similar event held at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI). For more information, see links below:
