	<p> My research includes optimal fluid mixing (How should one stir to optimally mix a concentration given a fixed energy budget?), 
	acoustic droplet vaporization (What ultrasonic waveforms will cause micron-sized droplets to vaporize?), 
	and confined active soft matter (What are the dynamics of a droplet containing active matter?).
