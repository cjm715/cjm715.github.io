Hi, I'm Chris Miles. I'm currently working as a software engineer and have a background in mathematical physics. I've enjoyed working on a range of topics spanning science and engineering such as machine learning, optimal control, ai accelerated hardware, dynamical systems, fluid dynamics, among others. On my free time, I enjoy woodworking, camping, traveling with my wife, and walking my dog Momo.
