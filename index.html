		Hi, I am a graduate student in the Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics MS and Physics PhD programs at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am working with Prof. Charles Doering on optimal fluid mixing for my PhD dissertation. We are interested in how the interplay of advection and diffusion affect optimal fluid mixing rates. My additional research interests include topics within nonlinear dynamics and non-equilibrium statistical physics.
